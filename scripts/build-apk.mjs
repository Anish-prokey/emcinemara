/**
 * Build an installable Android APK of the game.
 *
 *   npm run apk
 *
 * Builds the web app, copies it into the Capacitor Android project, compiles a
 * debug APK and drops it at the repo root as EmCinemaRa-debug.apk, ready to
 * copy to a phone. A debug build installs directly on any device that allows
 * "install unknown apps"; the Play Store needs a signed release bundle instead,
 * which is a separate step.
 *
 * Needs Java 21 — Capacitor 8's Android library is compiled for it and nothing
 * older will build it. Set ANDROID_JAVA_HOME (or JAVA_HOME) to a JDK 21, or put
 * one at E:\tools\jdk-21, which is where it lives on the machine this was
 * written on.
 *
 * Gradle's cache defaults to E:\tools\gradle-home rather than the usual
 * ~/.gradle. The first build pulls several hundred MB into it, and C: on that
 * machine was down to 12 GB. Override with GRADLE_USER_HOME.
